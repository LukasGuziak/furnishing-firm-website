Hi everyone!
Now I start designing websites for a furniture company. They will be made using html, java script and sass. GULP was used to create it, by means of which it minimizes the css and js code and graphic files. I am starting the project on August 29, 2022, and its alpha version will soon be available on the test server lukasdevtest2.com .
